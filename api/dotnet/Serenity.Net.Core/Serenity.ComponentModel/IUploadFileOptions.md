## Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [CopyToHistory](IUploadFileOptions/CopyToHistory.md) { get; } | Should a copy of file placed in a special history folder on upload. This helps preserving old files on update. |
| [DisplayFileName](IUploadFileOptions/DisplayFileName.md) { get; } | If you have no original name property but use original name in file name with {4} format parameter, set this to true to force the upload editor to show file name. |
| [FilenameFormat](IUploadFileOptions/FilenameFormat.md) { get; } | Format of the file name like "ProductImage/{1:00000}/{0:00000000}_{2}". Parameter 0 is the row identity value, 1 is identity value / 1000, and 2 is a random string like 2cxs4bc, 3 is current date/time, 4 is original file name. You can also use the shortcut "ProductImage/~" which is equivalent to the prior sample. If you don't specify this, it will default to something like Product/ProductImage/~ which is generated by combining row class name and field name. |
| [JsonEncodeValue](IUploadFileOptions/JsonEncodeValue.md) { get; } | Only useful for uploading multiple files. Specifies whether to JSON encode value. If your field is a string field set it to true. |
| [OriginalNameProperty](IUploadFileOptions/OriginalNameProperty.md) { get; } | If you want to store original name of the file uploaded, set this to the name of another string field. Only used for single image uploads. |
