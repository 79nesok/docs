> This page is taken as a sample from free AdminLTE (https://almsaeedstudio.com/themes/AdminLTE/index.html) theme.

The page content, except some numbers calculated from Northwind tables, contains random data.

There is an accordion navigation menu on left which has a search feature by input above it. We'll talk about how to customize items there in later sections.

On top navigation, there is site name on left, along with a dropdown containing current user name on right, and a settings button through which we change change theme or active language.
