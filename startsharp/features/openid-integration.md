# OpenId Server Integration

We offer a package that integrates the Serenity Framework with the [OpenIddict](https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-core) package, making it easy to incorporate OAuth authentication into your application. 

Making it easy for third-party applications to use your services.

You can try out our mobile application that is using OpenId package to connect worklog example in our demo.
