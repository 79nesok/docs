# Getting Started

The best and fastest way to get your hands dirty on Serenity is _SERENE_, which is a sample application template.

You have three options to install _SERENE_ template:

* [Installing SERENE from Visual Studio Marketplace (Windows)](installing_serene_from_visual_studio_gallery.md)

* [Installing SERENE directly from Visual Studio (Windows)](installing_serene_directly_from_visual_studio.md)

* [Installing SERENE ASP.NET CORE version with SERIN (Linux, OSX, Windows)](instaling-serene-aspnet-core-version-with-serin.md)


> You don't have to use this template to work with Serenity.
>
> You can add Serenity libraries to any .NET project with NuGet.
>
> It is also possible to add Serenity as a GIT submodule to your project and keep it always up to date with source codes.
>
> We'll cover these and more in other chapters.
