# Getting Started

The best and fastest way to get your hands dirty on Serenity is _SERENE_, which is a sample application template.

You have three options to install _SERENE_ template:

* [Installing SERENE from Visual Studio Marketplace (Windows)](installing_serene_from_visual_studio_gallery.md)

* [Installing SERENE directly from Visual Studio (Windows)](installing_serene_directly_from_visual_studio.md)

* [Installing SERENE for Asp.Net Corewith SERIN (Linux, OSX, Windows)](instaling-serene-aspnet-core-version-with-serin.md)


> Serene is just an application template that is designed to give you a quick start.
> 
> For advanced developers, it is possible to add Serenity NuGet packages to an existing .NET project, configure some services and have a working Serenity application. 
>
> You might also choose to add Serenity sources as a GIT submodule to your project and keep it always up to date, instead of depending on Serenity NuGet packages.
>
> We'll cover these and more in other chapters.
