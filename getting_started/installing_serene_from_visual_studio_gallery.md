Click *Download* to transfer VSIX file to your computer.

## Install Template into Visual Studio

After download is finished, double click the downloaded VSIX file to start Visual Studio extension installation dialog 

> If you have both Visual Studio 2017 and 2015 installed, sometimes Visual Studio 2015 installer might pick up VSIX file so it only installs in Visual Studio 2015. If you experience this issue, right click the file, click *Open With* and choose *Visual Studio Version Selector*.
