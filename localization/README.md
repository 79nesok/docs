# Localization

> This section will be updated for Serenity v5

Most web applications must support a variety of languages. Sites like Youtube, Wikipedia, Facebook works in many languages.

First time a user visits such a site, a language for her is automatically chosen depending on the browser language (pre-determined by regional settings).

If automatic selection is not what they expect, users can set their preferred language and this selection is stored in a client-side cookie (or server side user profile table).

Once a language is chosen, all texts are displayed in the selected language.

Serenity platform is designed with localization in mind from the start.

If you are using *Serene / StartSharp* you can see this yourself by setting your browser language or 
changing the language under sidebar settings.
