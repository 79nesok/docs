# Registering Translations

There are several ways to define local text keys and translations, including:

  - Manually through ILocalTextRegistry.Add Method
  - Declaring nested static classes containing local text objects
  - Adding Description attribute to enumeration classes
  - JSON files in predetermined locations (~/scripts/serenity/texts and ~/scripts/site/texts)

We'll talk about all these methods.
