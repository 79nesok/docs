# Removing Northwind From Serene

After you take Northwind as a sample, and develop your own project, you would want to remove Northwind module artifacts from your project. 

Here is how to get rid of it.

We assume your solution name is *MyProject*, so you have *MyProject.Web* and *MyProject.Script* projects in your solution.

* Delete *MyProject.Web/Modules/Northwind* folder. This will remove all server side code related to Northwind.

* Delete *MyProject.Script/Northwind* folder to clean all script code related to Northwind.
