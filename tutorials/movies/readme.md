# Tutorial: Movie Database

Let's create editing interface for some site similar to IMDB with Serenity.


### Create a new project named *MovieTutorial*

In Visual Studio click File -> New Project. Make sure you choose *Serene* template. Type *MovieTutorial* as name and click *OK*.

In Solution explorer, you should see two projects with names *MovieTutorial.Web* and *MovieTutorial.Script*.

> Make sure *MovieTutorial.Web* is the startup project (it should be bold), if not right click on project name and click *Set As Startup Project*.



### What Are These Project Files?

Serenity applications usually has at least two projects. One for server side code plus static resources like css files, images etc. (MovieTutorial.Web) and one for client side code (MovieTutorial.Script).

MovieTutorial.Script looks like an ordinary C# class library but the code it contains is actualy compiled to Javascript using Saltarelle. 

> Its output (MovieTutorial.Script.js) will be copied to folder *Scripts/site/* under *MovieTutorial.Web*. So at runtime, only MovieTutorial.Web project is used.



### Creating *Movie* Table

To store list of movies we need a Movie table. We could create this table using old-school techniques like SQL Management Studio but we prefer creating it as a *migration* using *Fluent Migrator*:

> Fluent Migrator is a migration framework for .NET much like Ruby on Rails Migrations. Migrations are a structured way to alter your database schema and are an alternative to creating lots of sql scripts that have to be run manually by every developer involved. Migrations solve the problem of evolving a database schema for multiple databases (for example, the developerâ€™s local database, the test database and the production database). Database schema changes are described in classes written in C# that can be checked into a version control system.

> See https://github.com/schambers/fluentmigrator for more information on FluentMigrator.

Using *Solution Explorer* navigate to *MovieTutorial.Web / Modules / Common / Migrations / DefaultDB*.

![Initial Migration Folder](img/movies_migration_initial.png)

Here we already have three migrations. A migration is like a DML script that manipulates database structure.

*DefaultDB_20141103_140000_Initial.cs* contains our initial migration that created *Northwind* tables and *Users* table.

Create a new migration file in the same folder with name *DefaultDB_20150915_185137_Movie.cs*. You can copy and change one of the existing migration files, rename it and change contents.

> Migration file name / class name is actually not important but recommended for consistency and correct ordering.

*20150915_185137* corresponds to the time we are writing this migration in yyyyMMdd_HHmmss format. It will also act as a unique key for this migration.

Our migration file should look like below:

```cs
using FluentMigrator;
using System;

namespace MovieTutorial.Migrations.DefaultDB
{
    [Migration(20150915185137)]
    public class DefaultDB_20150915_185137_Movie : Migration
    {
        public override void Up()
        {
            Create.Schema("mov");

            Create.Table("Movie").InSchema("mov")
                .WithColumn("MovieId").AsInt32().Identity().PrimaryKey().NotNullable()
                .WithColumn("Title").AsString(200).NotNullable()
                .WithColumn("Description").AsString(1000).Nullable()
                .WithColumn("Storyline").AsString(Int32.MaxValue).Nullable()
                .WithColumn("Year").AsInt32().Nullable()
                .WithColumn("ReleaseDate").AsDateTime().Nullable()
                .WithColumn("Runtime").AsInt32().Nullable();    
        }

        public override void Down()
        {
        }
    }
}
```

> Make sure you use the namespace *MovieTutorial.Migrations.DefaultDB* as Serene template applies migrations only in this namespace to the default database.

In *Up()* method we specify that this migration, when applied, will create a schema named *mov*. We will use a separate schema for movie tables to avoid clashes with existing tables. It will also create a table named *Movie* with "MovieId, Title, Description..." fields on it.

We could implement *Down()* method to make it possible to undo this migration (drop movie table and mov schema etc), but for the scope of this sample, lets leave it empty.

> Inability to undo a migration won't hurt much, but deleting a table by mistake could do more damage.

On top of our class we applied a Migration attribute.

```cs
[Migration(20150915185137)]
```

This specifies a unique key for this migration. After a migration is applied to a database, its key is inserted into a special table specific to FluentMigrator ([dbo].[VersionInfo]), so same migration won't be applied again.

> Migration key should be in sync with class name (for consistency) but without underscore as migration keys are Int64 numbers.
