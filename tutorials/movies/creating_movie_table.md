# Creating Movie Table

To store a list of movies, we need a `Movie` table. We could create this table using old-school techniques like SQL Management Studio, but we prefer creating it as a *migration* using *Fluent Migrator*:

> Fluent Migrator is a migration framework for .NET, much like Ruby on Rails Migrations. Migrations are a structured way to alter your database schema and are an alternative to creating lots of SQL scripts that have to be run manually by every developer involved. Migrations solve the problem of evolving a database schema for multiple databases (for example, the developerâ€™s local database, the test database, and the production database). Database schema changes are described in classes written in C# that can be checked into a version control system. See https://github.com/schambers/fluentmigrator for more information on FluentMigrator.

> Please Note: As we are using FluentMigrator in our samples, some users assume that Serenity doesn't work without it. That's not correct. You don't have to use migrations. Serenity has no direct dependency on migrations.
>
> If you prefer, instead of using these migrations, you may manually create tables in SQL Management Studio. You could also work with an existing database.

## Locating the Migration Folder

To locate the Migration Folder, use the *Solution Explorer* to navigate to `Migrations/DefaultDB`.

![Initial Migration Folder](img/initial_migration_folder.png)

Within this folder, you'll find several migrations. Think of a migration as a DML script that modifies the structure of your database.

For example, `DefaultDB_20141103_1400_Initial.cs` represents our initial migration, responsible for creating the Language table and the `Users` table.

## Creating a New Migration for the Movie Table

Create a new migration file and name it `DefaultDB_20221114_1505_MovieTable.cs`. You can duplicate one of the existing migration files, change its name, and modify its contents as needed.

While the migration file name and class name are not critical, it's recommended to maintain consistency and ensure correct ordering. For Serenity applications, we prefer the format `{TheDB}_yyyyMMdd_HHmm_{Description}`. 

Your migration file should look like this:

```cs
using FluentMigrator;

namespace MovieTutorial.Migrations.DefaultDB;

[DefaultDB, MigrationKey(20221114_1505)]
public class DefaultDB_20221114_1505_MovieTable : AutoReversingMigration
{
    public override void Up()
    {
        Create.Table("Movie")
            .WithColumn("MovieId").AsInt32()
                .Identity().PrimaryKey().NotNullable()
            .WithColumn("Title").AsString(200).NotNullable()
            .WithColumn("Description").AsString(1000).Nullable()
            .WithColumn("Storyline").AsString(Int32.MaxValue).Nullable()
            .WithColumn("Year").AsInt32().Nullable()
            .WithColumn("ReleaseDate").AsDateTime().Nullable()
            .WithColumn("Runtime").AsInt32().Nullable();
    }
}
```

In `Up()` method we specify that this migration, when applied, will create a table named `Movie` with fields such as `MovieId`, `Title`, `Description`, etc.

On top of our class we applied a Migration attribute.

```cs
[MigrationKey(20221114_1505)]
```

This specifies a unique key for this migration. After a migration is applied to a database, its key is recorded in a special table specific to FluentMigrator (`[dbo].[VersionInfo]`), preventing the same migration from being applied again.

> Note: The migration key should be in sync with the class name for consistency. Migration keys are Int64 numbers, but you can use underscores in them, which is a feature of C# 7.0.

Migrations are executed in key order, and using a sortable datetime pattern for migration keys is a good practice, as demonstrated here.

Please ensure that you consistently use the same number of digits for migration keys. In this example, we use 12 digits (e.g., 20221114_1505). To achieve this, zero-pad single-digit month, day, hour, and minute values to two digits. Neglecting this consistency can lead to complications in the migration order and may result in migration errors due to migrations running in an unexpected sequence.

The `[DefaultDB]` attribute indicates that this migration applies to the `Default` database. It identifies which migrations should be run against which database, especially if your application uses multiple databases.

It is a short version of `[FluentMigrator.Tags("DefaultDB")]` and is defined in Serenity.Extensions namespace.

## Running Migrations

By default, Serene automatically runs all migrations when the application starts.

The code responsible for running migrations is located in the `Initialization/Startup.cs` and `Initialization/DataMigrations.cs` files.

**DataMigrations.cs**:
```cs
namespace MovieTutorial.AppServices;

public class DataMigrations : IDataMigrations
{
    //...
    public void Initialize()
    {
        foreach (var databaseKey in databaseKeys)
        {
            EnsureDatabase(databaseKey);
            RunMigrations(databaseKey);
        }
    }

    private void EnsureDatabase(string databaseKey)
    {
        //...
    }

    private void RunMigrations(string databaseKey)
    {
        //...
            runner.MigrateUp();
        //...
    }
}
```

## Running Migrations

Now press `F5` to run your application and create the `Movie` table in the default database by executing the migrations.

## Verifying That the Migration is Run

To verify that the migration has been executed, you can use `Sql Server Management Studio` or go to `Visual Studio -> Tools -> Connect To Database`. Open a connection to the `MovieTutorial_Default_v1` database on the server `(localdb)\MsSqlLocalDB`.

In the SQL Object Explorer, you should see the `[dbo].[Movie]` table.

Additionally, if you view the data in the `[dbo].[VersionInfo]` table, the Version column in the last row of the table should be `20221114150500`. This indicates that the migration with that version number (migration key) has already been executed on this database. 

> Please note that the version key in the database contains the seconds part, e.g. `00` at the end. We no longer use seconds in the migration key we enter but it is still part of the actual migration key for compatibility reasons.

So, even if you change the migration source code, that migration won't run again in this database. It's a good practice to avoid modifying migrations after they have been applied. If necessary, create a new migration.
