# Creating Lookup Tables

Let's start by creating lookup tables we'll need.

Here is a list of these tables:

* Meeting Types (Board Meeting, Weekly Analytics, SCRUM Meeting, Annual Meeting, so on...)
* Locations (where meeting will be held, room numbers, address etc.)
* Agenda Types (what subject(s) an agenda is about, might be multiple)
* Units (which unit is organizing the meeting)
