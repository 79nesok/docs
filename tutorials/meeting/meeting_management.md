# Meeting Management (In Progress...)

In this tutorial we are going to develop a meeting management system that will help us keep a track of corporate meetings. 

We'll first plan a meeting, with its location, time, agenda and attendees, then send an invitation to those attendees with an e-mail.

Application will also let us store decisions taken in the meeting, and will inform attendees with a meeting report e-mail containing these decisions.
