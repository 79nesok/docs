# Serenity 8.1.5 Release Notes (2023-12-14)

## New Method of Restoring Node Types from Package/Project References

Serenity feature packages such as `Serenity.Extensions` and `Serenity.Pro.DataAuditLog` are primarily shipped as NuGet packages. These packages contain scripts and TypeScript types that may need referencing from your projects.

Since these feature packages lack corresponding NPM packages, referencing them via `package.json` is typically not feasible. While we could offer NPM package counterparts, maintaining synchronization with NuGet package versions in your project would pose a challenge.

Another issue arises when utilizing feature packages or your own features as project references. In such cases, you would need to publish to NPM for every change or employ `file:` style references in `package.json` to their project folders.

Serenity has previously addressed these issues automatically by scanning your project and NuGet package references, creating necessary mock types under your `node_modules/` folder by copying them from the `dist/` folder of the relevant packages or projects. This results in files such as:

- `node_modules/@serenity-is/serenity.extensions/dist/index.d.ts`
- `node_modules/@serenity-is/serenity.pro.dataauditlog/dist/index.d.ts`

This feature might go unnoticed by Serenity users, as the `node_modules` folder is not visible in Visual Studio.

When the `npm install` command is executed, the NPM command clears the `node_modules` folder and reinstalls dependencies referenced in `package.json`. However, during this process, our mock types installed via the dotnet build process are lost.

To address this issue, we introduced a special script in `package.json` that runs the `RestoreTypings` target using `dotnet`:

```json
//...
"scripts": {
    "prepare": "dotnet build -target:RestoreTypings"
```

This ensures that after the npm install process completes, the custom target `RestoreTypings` in the Serenity.Web project runs and restores mock types.

However, some issues could still occur. For instance, source generators in `Serenity.Pro.Coder` may run in the interval between `npm install` and `RestoreTypings`, potentially breaking the generated code if the `index.d.ts` files of mock types are momentarily absent.

To enhance the user experience, we have devised a better solution. Instead of creating mock package files directly under `node_modules/@serenity-is/serenity.extensions`, etc., Serenity will now create similar directories under `node_modules/.dotnet/`:

- `node_modules/.dotnet/serenity.extensions/package.json`
- `node_modules/.dotnet/serenity.extensions/dist/index.d.ts`
- `node_modules/.dotnet/serenity.pro.dataauditlog/package.json`
- `node_modules/.dotnet/serenity.pro.dataauditlog/dist/index.d.ts`

Notably, placing them under a folder starting with a dot (`.`) is advantageous, as NPM considers such folders as system/hidden, avoiding interference during installs.

These folders are named based on project/package names, with auto-generated `package.json` files containing JSON like the example below:

```json
{
  "name": "@serenity-is/extensions",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/index.js"
    }
  },
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "import": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts"
}
```

Moreover, these packages are automatically placed under the `dependencies` section of your project's `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "startsharp.web",
  "dependencies": {
    //...
    "@serenity-is/extensions": "./node_modules/.dotnet/serenity.extensions",
    "@serenity-is/pro.dataauditlog": "./node_modules/.dotnet/serenity.pro.dataauditlog",
```

Serenity updates your `package.json` file, adding these dependencies automatically. If a dependency has a manually specified version or a `file:` reference not starting with `./node_modules/.dotnet`, Serenity avoids touching them to respect your preferences.

This approach ensures that every time your project builds, these dependencies are checked against your project/package references and updated if necessary. Defining package dependencies in `package.json` also allows TypeScript to analyze them, providing better `import X from...` suggestions during editing when a type is not in your import statements.

Upon the initial Git clone or manual deletion of the `node_modules` folder for any reason, the `.dotnet` folder might be lost. Therefore, include the following script in your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
    "preinstall": "dotnet build -target:RestoreNodeTypes"
}
```

Remove the `prepare` script and replace it with the `preinstall` script above.

Additionally, we recommend removing existing NPM version-based `@serenity-is/corelib` and `@serenity-is/sleekgrid` dependencies in `package.json`. Let Serenity automatically create those dependencies from your package reference versions. This way, you won't have to manually update their versions in `package.json` after updating NuGet packages like `Serenity.Corelib` and `Serenity.SleekGrid`.

It is also advisable to modify the path mapping for `@serenity-is/*` modules in your `tsconfig.json` file, as shown below:

```json
//...
"paths": {
      "@/*": [ "./Modules/*" ],
      "@serenity-is/*": [ "./node_modules/@serenity-is/*/dist/index", "./node_modules/.dotnet/serenity.*/dist/index" ]
//...
}
```

This ensures that even if the regular package folders under `node_modules/@serenity-is/` are momentarily removed during `npm install`, TypeScript and source generators can still locate the types under `node_modules/.dotnet/` folders.

**`[BREAKING CHANGE]`** Serenity.Scripts is Obsolete

The `Serenity.Scripts` package is obsolete and should be replaced with `Serenity.Corelib` in your project file. This corresponds to the `@serenity-is/corelib` NPM package.

Update the `~/Serenity.Scripts/Serenity.Corelib.js` line in your `appsettings.bundles.json` to `~/Serenity.Corelib/index.global.js`.

## Some Legacy Scripts are Removed from Serenity.Assets

We have removed `jQuery.blockUI.js` and `toastr.js` from the Serenity.Assets package, as they are no longer in use. Please remove them from `appsettings.bundles.json` if you still have them listed.
