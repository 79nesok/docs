# Serenity 6.2.1 - 6.2.4 Release Notes (2022-10-11)

## Fixed DefaultSqlConnections Null Reference Exception Causing Sergen to Fail (6.2.1)

We added logging support in 6.2.0 to Sql methods, but as logging via dependency injection is not available in Sergen environment, and we missed a null check in DefaultSqlConnections, sergen command was failing.

## Recreated `package-lock.json` File While Building VSIX Template (6.2.2, StartSharp)

We normally have a directory reference to `corelib` in our `package.json` during development:

```json
{
  "name": "startsharp.web",
  "dependencies": {
    "@serenity-is/corelib": "file:../../Serenity/src/Serenity.Scripts/corelib",

```

This allows us to test our changes in `corelib` without having to publish an npm package, directly from the `Serenity` submodule in `StartSharp`.

During packaging of VSIX template, an automated process updated this dependency to the latest version of corelib at npm:

```json
{
  "name": "startsharp.web",
  "dependencies": {
    "@serenity-is/corelib": "6.1.4",
```

But as this does not affect `package-lock.json`, that still contains the folder reference. 

We distribute `package.json` and `package-lock.json` together in the StartSharp template. So when someone creates a new project from our template, `package-lock.json` still contained a folder reference.

This was causing npm to create a symlink to a non-existent folder instead of downloading corelib from npm.

This is now fixed as our automated process deletes the `package-lock.json` and `node_modules` folder after patching `package.json` and running `npm install` command after, so that users will get a valid `package-lock.json` file.

If you created a project with StartSharp template between 6.1.0 - 6.2.1, you may need to update Serenity packages, delete `package-lock.json` and `node_modules` and run npm install.

## Fix Modular Typings Restore for Package References in `node_modules` Folders (6.2.2, StartSharp)

We had a target in `Serenity.Pro.Coder` file which restores modular typings from package / project references to folders under `node_modules` instantly in Visual Studio / during build.

This was a workaround to ship modular typing files with NuGet packages that can be used by TypeScript, as it can't find those files under user's nuget folders (which might change for every user / pc). 

Due to an expression mistake in MSBuild target file, the typings for Serenity.Pro.Extensions package was being restored to an invalid folder like `node_modules\@serenity-is\pro.extensions;@serenity-is\pro.extensions` instead of `node_modules\@serenity-is\pro.extensions` only.

If your project had reference to Serenity.Pro.Coder 6.1.0 - 6.2.1, you may need to update Serenity packages and delete `node_modules` folder then run `npm install`.

## Moved RestoreTypings to Serenity.Net.Web

We had a `RestoreTypings` target in `Serenity.Pro.Coder` and `common-features` that restores `index.d.ts` files from NuGet package and project references to `typings` folder for namespaced ones and to the `node_modules\@serenity-is` folders for modular ones without having to run `sergen restore`.

This meant, it only worked with projects that reference `Serenity.Pro.Coder` package. We now moved that msbuild target to `Serenity.Net.Web` package so that this feature can be used for other projects.

After updating `Serenity.Net.Web` you may notice that even if you clear `typings` folder while having Visual Studio open, the directories and files will be restored instantly.

If you don't want this feature for some reason, add this line to your project:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <RestoreTypings>false</RestoreTypings>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## Fixed the Problem Causing Grids To Not Display Data in Serene After Updating to 6.1.x (6.2.4)

`DataGrid.defaultRowHeight` and `DataGrid.defaultHeaderHeight` values are undefined by default. This values are passed to the SlickGrid instance via `getSlickOptions()` method of the `DataGrid` class. 

As we rewrote SlickGrid as `SleekGrid` and made `jQuery` an optional dependency, this caused an issue in Serene when you update `Serenity` packages to latest versions.

We used `Object.assign` in place of `jQuery.extend` method to apply default SlickGrid options to the options you pass to the SlickGrid constructor. They are mostly compatible, but seems like there is a subtle but important difference between them.

While, `jQuery.extend` skips properties that have `undefined` value, `Object.assign` does not. Thus, the undefined default row height passed from `getSlickOptions` to the grid was overriding the SlickGrid default value.

We couldn't reproduce this issue in StartSharp because the premium theme sets `DataGrid.defaultRowHeight` to compensate for the larger default font size.
