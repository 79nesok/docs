# Serenity 6.2.6 Release Notes (2022-10-18)

## Descending Columns Sorted First When Multiple Sort Orders Are Defined (fixed in 6.2.5)

Previously, when multiple sorted columns were defined in `Column.cs`, the sorting order behaved unexpectedly. For instance:

```cs
public class SomeColumns
{
    [SortOrder(1)]
    public string Column1 { get; set; }
    [SortOrder(2, descending: true)]
    public string Column2 { get; set; }
}
```

The grid was expected to be sorted by `Column1` followed by `Column2 DESC`, but it was the opposite: `Column2 DESC` followed by `Column1`.

This issue was caused by the way sort orders were passed to the client side, where descending orders were represented as negative values (e.g., `Column2` had a sort order of `-2`).

This has been fixed by introducing a simple `Math.abs()` call during the initial sort order calculation (thanks to @RaportTrap, e.g. A. Schl√∂gelhofer).

## Published `tsbuild` Helpers as `@serenity-is/tsbuild` Npm Package

The node script file `tsbuild.js`, responsible for calling `esbuild` to compile `modular-style TypeScript` code, has now been distributed as an npm package. `tsbuild.js` now imports that package, allowing for easier updates and fixes when necessary.

## Two-Level Cache Group Expiration Applied To More Groups Than Required

In the `TwoLevelCache` system in Serenity, a cache group key-based cache invalidation feature is present, enabling the expiration of items belonging to a common group in the distributed cache, without needing to know the keys for individual cached items.

For example, if you have cached data derived from `UserRow` records, like individual user information cached by id/username, it's possible to expire all such items when something in the `User` row changes.

The `ExpireGroupItems` method changes the `generation number` of the `group`, automatically expiring all cached items that use the `old generation number`. This is called by the `InvalidateOnCommit` extension method within the Save/Delete handlers after the transaction is committed.

Previously, during a batch update where multiple records were updated in a transaction, group generation changes could occur multiple times for the same entity type. This caused the distributed cache to be updated unnecessarily. An optimization was introduced to bundle those generation changes into a single change per group key.

This optimization worked correctly until the transition to .NET dependency injection. Due to the porting to .NET 5 DI, it was observed that this optimization was causing unnecessary group key generation changes originating from unrelated transactions.

For example, if a change was made in the `Users` table, this helper would reset only the `Users` group generation, as expected. However, if a subsequent call modified the `Language` table, it would also reset the cache for `Users` in addition to the `Language` table.

This issue has been resolved, but it might have some side effects. As the cache is no longer reset for unrelated entities, you may occasionally notice that it used to randomly reset the cache before the fix but no longer does so.

## Reverted Microsoft.Data.SqlClient from 4.1.0 back to 3.1.1 in Sergen

Recently, we received error reports from our users regarding `sergen` being unable to connect to the SQL database due to a certificate issue. The solution to this problem was adding `TrustServerCertificate=true` to the connection string.

Interestingly, the portal could connect to the SQL server without needing that setting. In response to this, we conducted an investigation to identify the cause. The only notable difference we found was related to the version of the `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` package. While `sergen` had a direct reference to `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient 4.1.0`, `StartSharp`/`Serene` indirectly used version `2.0.1` via `FluentMigrator` and `Serenity.Data` packages.

We discovered the following document on the internet:

[Released: General Availability of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient 4.0](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/released-general-availability-of-microsoft-data-sqlclient-4-0/ba-p/2983346)

This document highlighted a crucial change; in versions `4.x+`, `Encrypt=true`, meaning wire encryption for the connection between the client and SQL server, became the default setting for `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`. Encryption necessitates the presence of a certificate, and most SQL server installations have local untrusted or development certificates. Some older versions do not even support encryption.

As the document advises, it's recommended to install a trusted certificate on your SQL server. If you cannot do this, you may use `Encrypt=false` in your connection string or `TrustServerCertificate=true`. However, these settings are not usually recommended for security reasons.

We acknowledge the reasons behind this change, but it represents a significant breaking change, which uniquely affected `sergen` as it was using `4.1.0`. Consequently, most users assumed that the issue was with `sergen` itself.

In the future, we plan to use the latest versions of `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`, which is currently `5.x`. However, we understand that most users do not read the change logs. If we were to update the package, it could potentially cause problems for them, particularly if these issues surfaced in a production environment. As a result, for the time being, we are reverting to the latest `3.x` release, specifically `3.1.1`, for both `sergen` and `Serenity.Data`.

You have the option to update the `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` version in your application or set `Encrypt=true` in your connection strings to use encrypted connections (which is recommended). Alternatively, you can wait for our package update to see if it resolves the issue.

## Added a `NodeScriptRunner` Class to `Serenity.Web` for Running Node Scripts on Application Startup

As you may already know, we have been working on ES module support since version 6.1. Previously, users had to manually run `node tsbuild --watch` in their project directory during development to enable compile-on-save support, similar to TypeScript's `compileOnSave` option.

To streamline this process, we've introduced the `NodeScriptRunner` and a relevant `IApplicationBuilder` extension method to handle this task automatically. Now, during application startup, the watching process is initiated automatically, and you will receive output from `esbuild` in your console log. When the application stops, the background watch process should also terminate.

The blog post detailing the transition to ES modules has been updated to reflect this new feature: [Read more](https://serenity.is/blog/2022/10/15/switching-to-es-modules)

This feature comes pre-enabled in projects created from StartSharp 6.2.6+. For others, you can enable it by following the instructions provided in the blog post.

## In-Place Add Dialog Types are Automatically Imported into the `*Form.ts` Files Generated by Sergen / Pro.Coder

We offer an `InplaceEdit` option along with the corresponding `DialogType` property in `LookupEditor` attributes. When enabled, it displays a button next to the editor, allowing you to add or edit the records listed in the dropdown editor.

When the `DialogType` is not explicitly specified, we use the lookup key, as long as they match. For example, if the lookup key is `Administration.Role` and the dialog class is `MyProject.Administration.RoleDialog`, the system handles it seamlessly.

In the context of namespaces, finding a dialog class by its full or partial name was possible by searching under the global scope (e.g., `window`). However, with the shift to ES module-style dialogs, they are not loaded into the global scope. They may not even be loaded at all unless explicitly imported somewhere.

This transition to ES modules posed some challenges for the in-place add feature, particularly when clicking the in-place button. What worked before may have seemed to stop working.

To address this, we've implemented a workaround. As long as you use the corresponding `Form.ts` files in your calling dialogs (which `sergen` automatically does when generating the code for the first time), the system will handle the dialog types seamlessly.

```ts
// UserDialog.ts
import { UserForm, UserRow, UserService } from "../";
//...

@Decorators.registerClass()
export class UserDialog extends EntityDialog<UserRow, any> {
    // ...

    protected form = new UserForm(this.idPrefix);
```

In the example above, we import `UserForm` and use it. Keep in mind that importing is not enough; you also need to reference or use it somewhere, as `esbuild` may remove the import from the output if it's unused.
Suppose you've added `InplaceAdd = true` to the `UserForm.cs` roles property:

```cs
    [FormScript("Administration.User")]
    public class UserForm
    {
        //...
        [LookupEditor(typeof(RoleRow), Multiple = true, InplaceAdd = true)]
        public List<int> Roles { get; set; }
    }
```

For this to work, there must be a way for the `Roles editor` in `UserDialog` to locate the `RoleDialog` class.

This form definition in C# is serialized to JSON and passed to the client side. Therefore, the only thing the `Roles editor` knows about the dialog type is a simple string: `Administration.Role`.

When you click the in-place add button in `UserDialog`, it attempts to find `YourProject.Administration.RoleDialog`, but it can't. This is because the role dialog is defined within a module, not in the global scope:

![In-place add dialog not found](img/6.2.6/inplace-add-dialog-not-found.png)

A manual workaround involves manually importing `RoleDialog` from the `UserDialog`:

```cs
// UserDialog.ts
import { UserForm, UserRow, UserService } from "../";
import { RoleDialog } from "../Role/RoleDialog";

RoleDialog.name.toString();

//...

@Decorators.registerClass()
export class UserDialog extends EntityDialog<UserRow, any> {
    // ...

    protected form is new UserForm(this.idPrefix);
```

This workaround enables the `RoleDialog` to be located by the `Roles editor` in the `UserDialog`.

This simply imports the `RoleDialog` and pretends to be using it so that it is not erased by `esbuild`/TypeScript.

However, this may not work if the `@registerClass` decorator on `RoleDialog` did not include the full name:

```ts
@Decorators.registerClass()
export class RoleDialog extends EntityDialog<RoleRow, any> {
```

In the sample above, Serenity type registration knows nothing more than the class name is `RoleDialog`. Therefore, it is not possible to match this class with an `Administration.RoleDialog` since there could be multiple `Role` dialog classes in different modules.

But in namespaces mode, the class was placed in the `StartSharp.Administration` namespace. So Serenity could find its full name by scanning the `window` (this is normally done on jQuery's ready event). This is not possible with ES modules.

To address this, let's add the full name to the `registerClass` call:

```ts
@Decorators.registerClass('StartSharp.Administration.RoleDialog')
export class RoleDialog extends EntityDialog<RoleRow, any> {
```

Now, we have our `RoleDialog` displayed properly:

![Role Dialog After Registering](img/6.2.6/role-dialog-after-registering.png)

Starting from `Sergen` version 6.2.6, it will automatically add the full name to the `registerClass` decorators it generates. However, for the existing dialogs that you convert manually, you'll need to set the full name yourself as well.

Nonetheless, even after doing this, we still need to "fake import" the `RoleDialog` class into the `UserDialog.ts` file.

To simplify this process for our users who are accustomed to having the in-place add feature work as it did before, we are now generating these "fake imports" in the `UserForm.ts` file:

```ts
import { RoleDialog } from "@/Administration/Role/RoleDialog";

export interface UserForm {
    //..
}

export class UserForm extends PrefixedContext {
    //..
}

[RoleDialog]; // In-place add dialog types
```

This should resolve most such cases, but you still need to add the full name to the `registerClass` decorators for the ES module dialog classes you use for the in-place adding feature.

## Sergen Adds Full Name to @registerClass Decorators in Generated Code

As mentioned in the preceding topic, `sergen` now automatically appends the full name to `@registerClass` for newly generated modules, as it is a necessary step for proper registration of ES module classes:

```ts
@Decorators.registerClass('StartSharp.Administration.MyNewDialog')
export class MyNewDialog extends EntityDialog<RoleRow, any> {
```

For your existing classes that you convert to ES modules, please ensure to add the full name during the conversion process, taking into account your project name, module name, and class name.

## Sending an Empty Source Map with a 200 Status, Instead of 403

In `StartSharp 6.1.8`, we introduced a `SourceMapSecurityMiddleware` that allows you to optionally disable source maps in production.

Previously, we returned a 403, indicating a "not allowed" response, which led to some warnings being displayed in the browser console. To address this, we have now updated it to return an empty source map with an HTTP 200 status code, instead of a 403 response.
