# Serenity 6.1.8 Release Notes (2022-09-29)

> We'll publish these release notes for versions that deserve more explanation than short descriptions available in our [change log](https://github.com/serenity-is/Serenity/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Added SourceMapSecurity Middleware (StartSharp)

Even though source maps are very useful in development, they can be a security concern in production. We added a middleware to block access to your `.js.map` and `.css.map` files in non development environments, so that prying eyes can't look at your TypeScript source code. It is enabled in Startup via:

```ts
if (!env.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseSourceMapSecurity(new()
    {
        SkipPermission = Configuration["SourceMapSkipPermission"]
    });
}
```

This blocks access to map files in environments except development. 

There is also an option to specify a permission in `appsettings.json` -> `SourceMapSkipPermission` so that a user with that permission can still access `.map.js` files even in production (use with care!).

The middleware for this feature resides in `Serenity.Pro.Extensions` package.

We strongly recommend enabling ScriptBundling / CssBundling in production sites via appsettings.json files.

You may try this middleware in action at [serenity.is](https://serenity.is) and [our demo](https://demo.serenity.is)

## Added a Workaround for getPropertyItemsData Change

In Serenity 6.1.0, we added an ability to send more metadata, in addition to what available in form / columns properties by changing the format of the JSON returned from Form / Columns scripts.

Before that a form / columns script was simply a JSON array of PropertyItem objects:

```json
[
     {
          "name": "LanguageId",
          "title": "Db.Administration.Language.LanguageId",
          "editorParams": {
               "maxLength": 10
          },
          "maxLength": 10,
          "required": true,
          "width": 150
     },
     {
          "name": "LanguageName",
          "title": "Db.Administration.Language.LanguageName",
          "editorParams": {
               "maxLength": 50
          },
          "maxLength": 50,
          "required": true,
          "width": 150
     }
]
```

Now it is a class:

```json
{
     "items": [
          {
               "name": "LanguageId",
               "title": "Db.Administration.Language.LanguageId",
               "editorParams": {
                    "maxLength": 10
               },
               "maxLength": 10,
               "required": true,
               "width": 150
          },
          {
               "name": "LanguageName",
               "title": "Db.Administration.Language.LanguageName",
               "editorParams": {
                    "maxLength": 50
               },
               "maxLength": 50,
               "required": true,
               "width": 150
          }
     ],
     "additionalItems": []
}
```

As you see, the items are moved into a `items` property, and there is an `additionalItems` property that is unused in this sample. We would like to use these `additionalItems` to pass some info about items that are not used in the `Form` or `Columns` definitions. 

For example, if a columns definition has `Country` property, but not its related `CountryId` property, we may not know if the foreign key property `CountryId` is mandatory (not null) or not, or what its editor / formatter type is.

We used these `additionalItems` for a new inline grid editing sample in StartSharp (https://demo.serenity.is/AdvancedSamples/InlineEditing) that is more advanced than Product editing sample (https://demo.serenity.is/Northwind/Product). It uses [SleekGrid](https://github.com/serenity-is/sleekgrid)'s (our SlickGrid rewrite) cell navigation / editing functionality, while the legacy sample uses, well a legacy method.

The code written for new inline editing sample is just 36 lines of code (actually just 5 lines for editing), compared to 297 lines required in the legacy sample ;)

This is made possible by this `additionalItems` property, passing some server side information about editing in columns script.

We added `Q.getFormData()`, `Q.getColumnsData()` (and their `Async` versions) to support this new format. But, to keep backwards compatibility, we left `Q.getForm()`, `Q.getColumns` methods as is, e.g. they return an array as they did before.

These functions are also used in classes like `PropertyDialog`, `EntityDialog`, `EntityGrid` via their `getPropertyItems()` methods to receive information about `Columns` and `Form` items. Again, to keep compatibility as much as possible, we left them as is, but there is now `getPropertyItemsData` methods in those classes, that should be overridden instead of `getPropertyItems` where possible.

The `getPropertyItems` methods in those classes are now just a `return this.propertyItemsData.items` line and the actual loading is done in `getPropertyItemsData` methods:

```ts
protected getPropertyItems() {
    return this.propertyItemsData?.items || [];
}

protected getPropertyItemsData(): PropertyItemsData {
    var formKey = this.getFormKey();

    if (!Q.isEmptyOrNull(formKey)) {
        return Q.getFormData(formKey);
    }

    return { items: [], additionalItems: [] };
}
```

The code above is an excerpt from `EntityDialog.ts`. This is not a breaking change for ordinary subclasses, as long as both the `Serenity.Web` and `Serenity.Scripts` are 6.1.0+. Otherwise, as the JSON sent by the server is different than what the script code expects, it might break your forms / grids.

Anyway, this still caused a breaking change in rare case where a dialog's `getFormKey` is not overriden (e.g. the dialog does not have a corresponding form class), but the dialog returns it's hardcoded form items by overriding its `getPropertyItems` method:

```ts
class SomeDialog {
    // note, there is no getFormKey() method here

    getPropertyItems() {
        return [
            {
                name: 'Some',
                //...
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

So this code does not call `super.getPropertyItems()`. The original `getPropertyItems` used to call `getFormKey` followed by `Q.getFormData`, which tried to load that form script from the server.

But, when this user updated to 6.1.0+, the dialog broke because even though he didn't call `super.getPropertyItems()`, `getPropertyItemsData()` method is still called from `EntityDialog` itself, and tried to load the default form based on class name (`Form.SomeDialog`), resulting in a `can't load script data ...` error.

We are aware that not many users actually read change log / release notes so we added a workaround in 6.1.8:

```ts
protected getPropertyItems() {
    return this.propertyItemsData?.items || [];
}

protected getPropertyItemsData(): PropertyItemsData {
    var formKey = this.getFormKey();

    if (this.getFormKey === EntityDialog.prototype.getFormKey &&
        this.getPropertyItems !== EntityDialog.prototype.getPropertyItems &&
        !ScriptData.canLoad('Form.' + formKey)) {
        return {
            items: this.getPropertyItems(),
            additionalItems: []
        }
    }

    if (!Q.isEmptyOrNull(formKey)) {
        return Q.getFormData(formKey);
    }

    return { items: [], additionalItems: [] };
}
```

Above, we try to identify in `getPropertyItemsData` method, if the user overriden `getPropertyItems` in its subclass, while not overriding `getFormKey` method (e.g. don't have a form), and the default form name calculated from the class name is not available in registered scripts. This will probably handle 99% percent of cases, but if you are reading this, please override `getPropertyItemsData` instead to be sure.
