# Serenity 6.6.0 Release Notes (2023-03-15)

## New Criteria Builder for TypeScript

Unlike C#, Javascript has no operator overloading feature, so we had to design the Criteria system differently on the client side.

We also choose to use an array-based format for passing Criteria objects from the browser to the server. On the server, the Criteria objects have a polymorphic tree structure. The format we choose for Javascript is designed to be easily JSON serializable/de-serializable while keeping the types of constant values like numbers, strings, booleans, etc. intact.

For example, `[["Amount"], '>=', 5]` corresponds to a criteria expression `Amount >= 5`. Note the extra parenthesis around `"Amount"`. If we didn't have that it would correspond to a criteria expression `'Amount' >= 5` e.g. `the string` `'Amount'` greater than or equal to `5`", instead of "`the field` `Amount` greater than or equal to 5". 

The reasoning behind this is, it is allowed to have a constant in either part of the binary criteria, so we don't blindly assume that the first parameter is a `field name`. It can only be a `field name` if it is `an array` containing `a single string`. If it is not, it is a `string` value.

So, `[5, '>=', ['Amount']]` is equal to the expression: `5 >= Amount`.

Another reason for this is future extensibility; so that we can have criteria like the following:

`[['Amount1'], '+', ['Amount2'], '>=', 5]`

Which would be an expression corresponding to `Amount1 + Amount2 >= 5`. Note that such arithmetic operators are not yet supported.

For unary operators, the array syntax expects the operator to be the first element:

`['is null', ['Amount']]` => `Amount IS NULL`

We have some helper methods like the `Criteria.and()`, `Criteria.or()`, and `Criteria.Operator.isNull`, etc. constants so that you don't have to remember operator names, but you still have to remember the operator ordering:

```ts
Criteria.or(
    Criteria.and(
        [Criteria.Operator.isNotNull, ['Amount']],
        [['Amount'] >= 5]
    ),
    [['Status'], Criteria.Operator.in, [[1, 2, 3]]]
)
```

```sql
 ((Amount is not null) and (Amount >= 5)) or (Status in (1, 2, 3))
```

Notice the extra array used for the `IN` operator? That's another implementation detail that you should be careful about. 

Luckily, we now introduced a criteria builder function to make the above statement easier to type:

```ts
Criteria.or(
    Criteria.and(
        Criteria('Amount').isNotNull(),
        Criteria('Amount').ge(5)
    ),
    Criteria('Status').in([1, 2, 3])
)
```

It should be more readable than the previous version with code completion support, and as a bonus, you won't have to worry about the implementation details anymore.

## New `Criteria.parse` Function

If the criteria builder we mentioned above is still not friendly enough, or you would prefer to type criteria expressions in a simple string similar to an `SQL WHERE` statement, use the new `Criteria.parse` function:

```ts
Criteria.parse("((Amount is not null) and (Amount >= 5)) or (Status in (1, 2, 3))")
```

What if you wanted to make some of the values dynamic, e.g. get them from the UI? No, we will not suggest using string concatenation in any case. 

One of the reasons to avoid string concatenation to build SQL statements is to avoid SQL injection attacks. That risk does not apply here as this string is parsed on the client and converted to a JSON array before being passed to the server.

But it is possible to create invalid expressions, causing parsing errors, especially if the values are strings that might contain quotes.

So what do we do here? We use the parameterized syntax:

```ts
Criteria.parse("((Amount is not null) and (Amount >= @a)) or (Status in @s)`, {
    a: 5,
    s: [1, 2, 3]
})
```

This is similar to Dapper but please note that you should not use parenthesis with the `IN` statement with parameters. E.g. `Status in (@s)` is invalid, and `Status in (@s1, @s2)` is also invalid. The correct version is `Status in @s` where the value of s is an array.

OK, but still it might be possible to make typos for parameter names. And our answer to that is a special tagged string syntax we recommend:

```ts
Criteria.parse`((Amount is not null) and (Amount >= ${5})) or (Status in ${[1, 2, 3]})`
```

Looks much cleaner, don't you think?

## New Source Generator for ESM Entry Points

`Serenity.Pro.Coder` has a new source generator for paths to ESM entry points, e.g. the output paths of ESM modules under `wwwroot/esm/**/*Page.js` similar to what the MVC generator does for CSHTML files.

So when specifying the module for your pages, you will have compile time checking and intelli-sense support:

```cs
[Route("Administration/Language")]
public ActionResult Index()
{
    // instead of this.GridPage("@/Administration.Language.LanguagePage",
    return this.GridPage(ESM.Modules.Administration.Language.LanguagePage,
        LanguageRow.Fields.PageTitle());
}
```

## It is Now Recommended to Have a Default Export for Pages

For modular style page init scripts, like `LanguagePage.ts` we had a syntax like the one below:

```ts
import { initFullHeightGridPage } from "@serenity-is/corelib/q"
import { LanguageGrid } from "./LanguageGrid";

$(function() {
    initFullHeightGridPage(new LanguageGrid($('#GridDiv')).element);
});

// additional export just for demo
export class SomeOtherClass {
}
```

This initializes the page, e.g. executes the function wrapped in `$ (jQuery)` as soon as the module is imported anywhere. 

Although it is fine as long as you use the module only for the relevant page, there are some issues:

- It is not so testable
- It is not possible to use any exports you might have there without executing the page initialization block.
- If scripts for multiple pages are bundled together, both of their initialization blocks may execute.
- It is not possible to easily pass options to the initialization script

We now recommend an alternative syntax with a default export:

```ts
import { initFullHeightGridPage } from "@serenity-is/corelib/q"
import { LanguageGrid } from "./LanguageGrid";

export default function pageInit() {
    initFullHeightGridPage(new LanguageGrid($('#GridDiv'), opt).element);
}

// export default function pageInit(opt?: SomeOptions) {
// if you wanted to accept options, and pass them to the grid 
// or use them in another way

// additional export just for demo
export class SomeOtherClass {
}
```

And now:

- Possible to import, execute and test the initialization function selectively
- Pass it options
- Import SomeOtherClass

To use this syntax, you should switch to the `GridPage` extension method in `Serenity.Extensions` package we'll describe in the next topic, or use the syntax below in your view:

```html
<script type="module">
    import pageInit from '@Html.ResolveWithHash("~/esm/Modules/Administration/Language/LanguagePage.js")';
    pageInit();
</script>
```

## GridPage Extensions are moved into the `Serenity.Extensions` Package

During the switch to ES modules, we added an extension method called `GridPage` to `Serene` and `StartSharp` to be able to initialize pages written as ESM from the controller:

```cs
[PageAuthorize(typeof(LanguageRow))]
public class LanguageController : Controller
{
    [Route("Administration/Language")]
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        return this.GridPage("@/Administration/Language/LanguagePage",
            LanguageRow.Fields.PageTitle());
    }
}
```

There is no `LanguageIndex.cshtml` for this page as it is using the `Views/Shared/GridPage.cshtml`. 

> We got some comments from users thinking it is not possible to use ordinary Index.cshtml files to initialize modular pages anymore. You could still use classic views if you wanted:
> 
> ```cs
> [PageAuthorize(typeof(LanguageRow))]
> public class LanguageController : Controller
> {
>     [Route("Administration/Language")]
>     public ActionResult Index()
>     {
>         return View("~/Modules/Administration/Language/LanguageIndex.cshtml");
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> ```xml
> // LanguageIndex.cshtml
> @inject Serenity.ITextLocalizer Localizer
> @{
>     ViewData["Title"] = Localizer.Get("Db.Administration.Language.EntityPlural");
> }
> 
> <div id="GridDiv"></div>
> 
> <script type="module" src="@Html.ResolveWithHash("~/esm/Modules/Administration/Language/LanguagePage.js")">
> </script>
> ```

As this extension and its view were placed in Serene/StartSharp, it was not possible to use them from feature packages, like our sample ones. So we now moved them into `Serenity.Extensions`.

It is recommended to remove `GridPageExtensions.cs`, `GridPage.cshtml` files from your project and use the ones in `Serenity.Extensions` instead.

The new one also provides a `PanelPage` that creates a PanelDiv instead of a GridDiv.

And `GridPage` and `PanelPage` have overloads that use the new `ModelPage` extension which accepts a `ModulePageModel` with additional parameters:

```cs
public class ModulePageModel
{
    public string HtmlMarkup { get; set; } // markup, which is <div id="GridDiv"></div> for GridPage
    public object Options { get; set; } // options to pass to the pageInit method
    public string Layout { get; set; } // set layout to another view, e.g. _LayoutNoNavigation etc.
    public string Module { get; set; } // the path to esm module
    public string PageId { get; set; } // set s-PageId class in body, might be used for css etc.
    public LocalText PageTitle { get; set; } // page title
}
```

## Serenity Demo Module Views are Converted to ES Modules

Since we switched to ES modules, we are converting most of our code to modular TypeScript syntax. Even though the `@serenity-is/corelib`, `@serenity-is/extensions`, and most of our other features are rewritten as ES modules, at runtime they still work in the namespaces mode as we still have to support users who have namespace style code.

So even though the TypeScript code was converted to ES modules, the code in their views where written as namespace style javascript, confusing our users.

As `Serenity.Demo.BasicSamples` and `Serenity.Demo.AdvancedSamples` modules are not directly referenced or imported by your applications in TypeScript code, we decided to convert their views into ES modules as well. 

During this conversion, we also merged their `Grid.ts`, `Dialog.ts`, etc. files into a `Page.ts` file with a default `pageInit()` export, so that the TypeScript code for the sample can be viewed via just one file.

They don't yet use the `GridPage` or `PanelPage` extensions as their views contain extra HTML markup and links for sample-specific information.

We recommend having a look at their source code to better understand the changes.

Here is a simplified diff for `EntityDialogAsPanel`:

```diff
- <li><a href="javascript:myDialogAsPanel.load({}, function() { Q.notifySuccess('Switched to new record mode'); })">Switch to new record mode with Javascript</a></li>
+ <li><a id="SwitchToNewRecordMode" href="javascript:;">Switch to new record mode with Javascript</a></li>
- <li><a href="javascript:myDialogAsPanel.load(11048, function() { Q.notifySuccess('Loaded entity with ID 11048'); })">Load Order with ID 11048 with javascript</a></li>
+ <li><a id="LoadEntityWithId" href="javascript:;">Load Order with ID 11048 with javascript</a></li>
- @Html.BasicSamplesSourceFile("EntityDialogAsPanel.ts")
+ @Html.BasicSamplesSourceFile("EntityDialogAsPanelPage.ts")
 
 <div id="DialogDiv"></div>
 
-<script type="text/javascript">
-    var myDialogAsPanel;
-    jQuery(function () {
-        // first create a new dialog
-        myDialogAsPanel = new Serenity.Demo.BasicSamples.EntityDialogAsPanel();
-        // load a new entity if url doesn't contain an ID, or load order with ID specified in page URL
-        // here we use done event in second parameter, to be sure operation succeeded before showing the panel
-        myDialogAsPanel.load(@Html.Raw(Model.ToJson()) || {}, function() {
-            // if we didn't reach here, probably there is no order with specified ID in url
-            myDialogAsPanel.element.removeClass('hidden').appendTo('#DialogDiv');
-            myDialogAsPanel.arrange();
-        });
-    });
+<script type="module">
+    import pageInit from '@Html.ResolveWithHash(Html.BasicSamplesModuleFile("EntityDialogAsPanelPage.js"))';
+    pageInit(@Json.Serialize(Model));
```

Note that we are using `<script type=module>` in place of a regular script block. And instead of referencing the global namespace version like `new Serenity.Demo.BasicSamples.EntityDialogAsPanel()`, we are importing the page init function from the module `EntityDialogAsPanelPage.js`.

The code in the removed script block and the ones embedded in the href attributes are moved to the `Page.ts` file:

```ts
export default function pageInit(model: any) {

    // first create a new dialog, store it in globalThis, 
    // e.g. window so that sample can access it from outsite the module
    var myDialogAsPanel = new EntityDialogAsPanel();

    $('#SwitchToNewRecordMode').click(() => {
        myDialogAsPanel.load({}, function() { notifySuccess('Switched to new record mode'); });
    });

    $('#LoadEntityWithId').click(() => {
        myDialogAsPanel.load(11048, function() { notifySuccess('Loaded entity with ID 11048'); })
    });

    // load a new entity if url doesn't contain an ID, or load order with ID specified in page URL
    // here we use done event in second parameter, to be sure operation succeeded before showing the panel
    myDialogAsPanel.load(model || {}, function () {
        // if we didn't reach here, probably there is no order with specified ID in url
        myDialogAsPanel.element.removeClass('hidden').appendTo('#DialogDiv');
        myDialogAsPanel["arrange"]?.();
    });
}
```

Moving the code blocks into the page script will help with compile time error checking and let us use intelli-sense.

## Service Endpoints Derives from ControllerBase Instead of Controller

`ControllerBase` is the base class of `Controller` which adds view support in addition to a few other features related to pages. 

Our `Endpoint` (Service) classes don't require views, so we decided to use `ControllerBase` as the base class of `ServiceEndpoint`.

If you forgot to update `Serenity.Pro.Coder` or run `dotnet sergen update` after updating Serenity packages, as the base class for `ServiceEndpoint` is changed, old versions of these generators won't consider your service classes as valid controllers, and you may get TypeScript errors. So please update both `Serenity.Pro.Coder` and `sergen` and restart Visual Studio.

Also, if for some reason you returned a `View` from a `ServiceEndpoint` action, you will have to move that action into a page controller.

## Page and Endpoint Suffixes are Used Instead of Controller

ASP.NET MVC only considered classes whose name ended with `Controller` suffix to be used as Controllers, e.g. C in the MVC. It ignored classes with other types of names even if they derive from the `Controller` class.

So we had to name both our page controller and service endpoint classes as `LanguageController` and put them into different namespaces. Even though their files were named `LanguagePage.cs` and `LanguageEndpoint.cs`, the classes they contain were both named `LanguageController`.

Not sure which version they fixed this, but in ASP.NET Core this is no longer necessary. Any class which has the `[Controller]` attribute, regardless of the name is considered a controller. The classic `Controller` class derives from the `ControllBase` class, which has the `[Controller]` attribute so as long as your class derives from one of them it is considered a controller.

We updated `sergen` and `Serenity.Pro.Coder` to handle new suffixes `Page` and `Endpoint`, and renamed all our classes accordingly.

Some of these controllers like `Serenity.Pro.Meeting.MeetingController` were used in `Startup.cs` to register their assemblies:

```cs
typeof(Serenity.Pro.DataAuditLog.DataAuditLogController).Assembly,
typeof(Serenity.Pro.DataExplorer.DataExplorerController).Assembly,
typeof(Serenity.Pro.EmailClient.MailboxController).Assembly,
typeof(Serenity.Pro.EmailQueue.EmailQueueController).Assembly,
//...
```

We left them as an abstract obsolete copy of the corresponding Page classes, so you will only get warnings after updating Serenity packages, but you are recommended to change them to Page versions:

```cs
typeof(Serenity.Pro.DataAuditLog.DataAuditLogPage).Assembly,
typeof(Serenity.Pro.DataExplorer.DataExplorerPage).Assembly,
typeof(Serenity.Pro.EmailClient.MailboxPage).Assembly,
typeof(Serenity.Pro.EmailQueue.EmailQueuePage).Assembly,
//...
```

## New Options for Sergen

We added many options to Sergen to fine-tune the code generation and use new language features.

**SaveGeneratedTables**:

By default, sergen saves the options specified for generated table like `Identifier`, `Module`, etc. back into the `sergen.json`.

This information is pretty useless unless you are going to generate code again for the same table. It pollutes your sergen.json file and causes conflicts during merges. 

By setting this option to false, which is recommended, you may disable that. 

**ForeignFieldSelection**:

When specified, this overrides the set of foreign view fields that will be generated for a row. The default value for `ForeignFieldSelection` is All, e.g. all the fields of the joined foreign table will be generated as view fields.

```json
{
    "ForeignFieldSelection": "NameOnly"
}
```

This was the default behavior for sergen, which used to cause problems in some cases:

- It made the generated row classes too big
- It even generated view properties for log fields like CreatedBy, ModifiedOn, etc.
- Intellisense was polluted with many view fields that you are never going to use
- It is bad for performance as all these fields need to be checked for most validation etc. operations.
- When you removed, renamed, or changed the data type of some field in the joined table, it did not affect the rows using it, causing errors at runtime, especially when opening a dialog, as the default is to load all the fields.

To understand this better, let's say we have a `City` table with a foreign key to the `Country` table.

When you generate the code for `City` table, it produced a set of properties like this:

```cs
public class CityRow
{
    // table fields
    CityId
    CityName
    CountryId
    //... some other city fields
    CreatedBy
    CreatedOn
    ModifiedBy
    ModifiedOn


    // foreign view fields originating from CountryId FK join
    CountryName
    //...some other country fields
    CountryCreatedBy
    CountryCreatedOn
    CountryModifiedBy
    CountryModifiedOn
}
```

We now recommend setting this option to "NameOnly", which will bring only the "name" property of the foreign table into the currently generated row. So the set of properties generated will become:

```cs
public class CityRow
{
    CityId
    CityName
    CountryId
    CreatedBy
    CreatedOn
    ModifiedBy
    ModifiedOn

    CountryName
}
```

You may manually add fields you need later, preferably using the `[Origin]` attribute enjoying the compile time checking.

There is also a `None` option which causes it to generate none of the foreign view fields.

**IncludeForeignFields**:

This is an array of field names to additionally include when the `ForeignFieldSelection` is `NameOnly` or `None`.

This may allow you to selectively generate code for some additional foreign fields, that you always want to have in your generated row. 

For example, if you wanted to have `CreatedOn` and `ModifiedOn` in addition to the `Name` property in all generated rows:

```json
{
    "ForeignFieldSelection": "Name",
    "IncludeForeignFields": [
        "CreatedOn",
        "ModifiedOn"
    ]
}
```

**DeclareJoinConstants**:

When true, sergen will generate constants for every join alias it uses.

So, instead of such an entity:

```cs
public sealed class CustomerRow : Row<CustomerRow.RowFields>, IIdRow, INameRow
{
    const string jCity = nameof(jCity);

    //...    

    [DisplayName("City"), ForeignKey("[test].[City]", "CityId"), LeftJoin("jCity")]
    public int? CityId
    {
        get => fields.CityId[this];
        set => fields.CityId[this] = value;
    }

    [DisplayName("City Name"), Expression("jCity.[CityName]")]
    public string CityName
    {
        get => fields.CityName[this];
        set => fields.CityName[this] = value;
    }

    [DisplayName("City Country Id"), Expression("jCity.[CountryId]")]
    public int? CityCountryId
    {
        get => fields.CityCountryId[this];
        set => fields.CityCountryId[this] = value;
    }

    //...
}
```

it will generate the following:

```cs
public sealed class CustomerRow : Row<CustomerRow.RowFields>, IIdRow, INameRow
{
    const string jCity = nameof(jCity);

    //...    

    [DisplayName("City"), ForeignKey("[test].[City]", "CityId"), LeftJoin(jCity)]
    public int? CityId
    {
        get => fields.CityId[this];
        set => fields.CityId[this] = value;
    }

    [DisplayName("City Name"), Expression($"{jCity}.[CityName]")]
    public string CityName
    {
        get => fields.CityName[this];
        set => fields.CityName[this] = value;
    }

    [DisplayName("City Country Id"), Expression($"{jCity}.[CountryId]")]
    public int? CityCountryId
    {
        get => fields.CityCountryId[this];
        set => fields.CityCountryId[this] = value;
    }

    //...
}
```

This will make it easier to reference and rename join aliases in addition to compile-time checks and intelli-sense support.

It is also recommended to set this to true.

**FileScopedNamepaces**:

When true, generated code will use `File-Scoped Namespaces` feature introduced in C# 10.

So instead of this:

```cs
namespace MyApp.MyModule
{
    public class MyRow
    {
    }
}
```

you will get this one:

```cs
namespace MyApp.MyModule;

public class MyRow
{
}
```

**Enable Row Templates**:

This is a flag that should only be activated if you are using StartSharp, as row templates are only supported via the source generator in `Serenity.Pro.Coder` package.

When set to true, the generated rows will use the `RowTemplate` style:

```cs
public sealed partial class CustomerRow : Row<CustomerRow.RowFields>, IIdRow, INameRow
{
    class RowTemplate
    {
        [DisplayName("Customer Id"), Identity, IdProperty]
        public int? CustomerId { get; set; }

        [DisplayName("Customer Name"), Size(50), NotNull, QuickSearch, NameProperty]
        public string CustomerName { get; set; }

        [DisplayName("City"), ForeignKey("[test].[City]", "CityId"), LeftJoin("jCity"), TextualField(nameof(CityName))]
        public int? CityId { get; set; }

        [DisplayName("City Name"), Expression("jCity.[CityName]")]
        public string CityName { get; set; }

        [DisplayName("City Country Id"), Expression("jCity.[CountryId]")]
        public int? CityCountryId { get; set; }
    }
}
```

**OmitDefaultSchema**:

Our templates have to work with multiple database types, including `Sql Server`, `MySql`, `Sqlite`, `Firebird`, `Oracle`, etc. 

While SQL Server has schema support, in MySql schema is a synonym for a database, for Oracle, it is used in place of a username, while Sqlite has no schema support at all. So we avoid using database schemas and use prefixes like `wlog_` instead.

We usually work with `SQL Server` while developing our samples, and generate code via sergen in `SQL Server` first. Then we test it with other database types. 

But as the default schema is the `dbo` in `SQL Server`, Sergen generates expressions and table names including `dbo.` schema for our entities like `dbo.wlog_Customer`

Then, we have to remove these `dbo.` prefixes from expressions in our `XYZRow.cs` files manually.

This option, when enabled, does not include the default schema like `dbo.` in SQL server, and `public.` in Postgresql in generated expressions. 

If you have to support multiple database types like we do, we recommend setting this option to true.

**TSBuild => EntryPoints**:

By default, our tsbuild script considers TypeScript files matching the following glob patterns as entry points that are passed to the `esbuild`:

```
- Modules/**/*Page.ts
- Modules/**/ScriptInit.ts
```

If for some reason, you want to use some other patterns, you may set the `EntryPoints` under the `TSBuild` section in `sergen.json`:

```json
{
    "TSBuild": {
        "EntryPoints": [
            "Modules/**/*Page.ts",
            "Modules/**/ScriptInit.ts",
            "Modules/My/AdditionalEntry.ts",
            "Modules/**/*Page.tsx"
        ]        
    }
}
```

This list is also used by our new ESM source generator if it is specified.

You need to update `@serenity-is/tsbuild` in `packages.json` to `6.6.0` or later, and run `npm install`.

## Introduced CSS Rule for Site Logo Image

We had an HTML markup like the following in `_Sidebar.cshtml` and some of the other membership-related pages:

```html
<img class="s-sidebar-band-logo" src="~/Content/site/images/serenity-logo-w-128.png" />
```

As this is the Serenity logo, after creating your application from the template, you needed to change this logo in multiple places, which would be cumbersome.

And it was not possible for you to change the logo in the features we developed as NuGet packages, for example, the new OpenIddict module consent pages.

The new markup for site logo images in the `_Layout.cshtml` and other files is like below:

```html
<img class="s-site-logo-img s-sidebar-band-logo" />
```

As seen above, it does not include the image path; and contains just two CSS classes. 

To set the logo, you should add/edit the following line in your site.css file, replacing the Serenity logo with your logo image:

```css
.s-site-logo-img {
    content: url(/Content/site/images/serenity-logo-w-128.png);
}
```

There is also an `s-form-title-logo` class that adjusts the look of the logo in the forms, e.g. rounded with the sidebar band background. It might be used to adjust logo styling by overriding its CSS rules.

## ConfigureSection Attribute

There is now a `[DefaultSectionKeyAttribute]` and a `ConfigureSection` extension making use of it so that instead of:

```cs
services.Configure<Serenity.Pro.Extensions.BackgroundJobSettings>(
    Configuration.GetSection(Serenity.Pro.Extensions.BackgroundJobSettings.SectionKey));
```

in `Startup.cs` file, you may write:

```cs
services.ConfigureSection<Serenity.Pro.Extensions.BackgroundJobSettings>(Configuration);
```

## [Breaking Change] Q.Lookup Global Type is Removed for ES Modules

There is no longer a globally defined Q.Lookup interface while using ES modules. 

If you referenced it in some modular code, you should `import { Lookup } from "serenity-is/corelib/q"` and replace `Q.Lookup` with `Lookup` in your project.

## [Breaking Change] CKEditorBasePath default is changed to "~/Serenity.Assets/Scripts/ckeditor/"

The default path for `CKEditor` was "~/Serenity.Assets/Scripts/ckeditor/" for compatibility reasons. 

We were setting it in `ScriptInit.ts` to `~/Serenity.Assets/Scripts/ckeditor/` which is the new location.

We now removed the line in `ScriptInit.ts` and changed the default to `~/Serenity.Assets/Scripts/ckeditor/`.
